# a-real-php-game-without-sql-and-js
a game with a storie and a multiplayer interaction only in php without sql and js... a crasy project

the 'game' is in french'
ther is places were you have to write, they are noted with "[?]" and most of them have a description like "[?][titre]" to know what to write in it.
thats to help you to write rapidly, juste open all files with for exemple notepade++ and chaearch with Ctrl+F the [?] to find all blank to fill
most of the places are remplaced with variable in "data/base/variable" as php variables, to try to make you only have to write in one file

OH and just one litle but extremly important think, create a security to protect user's acounts,do not let the password in clear, even befor it was send.
